Todo: Integrate with RPOL. To GM a game, enter your RPOL login details and the thread. 
Everyone who has posted in the thread will be added to the game, along with their character profile.

Todos:
Todo: Build an event replacer for JS so I can have lots of event handlers for the same event.
 * EVENTER.onLoad.myAppName = function()
 * EVENTER.onLoad.(un)suspend('myAppName') (moves function to 'suspended' internal variable)
 * All events can now go through the eventer - allowing you to avoid having to method chain, and sort out what happens when you want to switch off your function.
Todo: Can still keep pressing buttons quickly to get position out of sync with server.
Todo: Users / Logins
Simple user details should suffice (email / password - create if not certain). 
No capcha until spambots show up.

	 * Create new maps by entering an image URL for the background, and a game id on RPOL (optionally specify a group).
	 * Mappable pulls in all of that games character avatars & names.
	 * GM is then presented with a list of characters and prompted to include/exclude & fill in movement info etc.
	 * customise: individual instances could be run for individual battles, with custom code inserted for specific maps.
Todo: Users/Objects & Moves
Todo: Users/Maps
Todo: Add RSpec tests for controllers/models.
Todo: Should be able to hook afterMove() (to do ajax-y stuff) and afterMoveSuccess() (which should only be called when all registered AJAX is finished.)
Todo: Diagonal movement.
Todo: Track whose turn it is and how much movement/action everything has this turn.
Todo: Get a list of every move made in a given turn.
Todo: Show a list of moves made this turn, last turn in the history.
Todo: Actions other than movement. Users can enter arbitrary text for actions 
 * Schema:
 * moves (action:text, moves_used:integer (may be negative e.g. activate boots of speed), t.remove_column 'abilities')
 * Controllers/Resources:
 *  * Moves
 *  *  * get /maps/id/turns/turn_number/moves (list moves, by object. sort objects by initiative when they have it.)
Todo: Squares with higher / lower movement costs (immutable objects?).
Todo: Don't prevent moves which break the rules - instead allow the player to enter an explanation which the GM may accept or deny. 
Todo: Delayed commit for actions (ie show a stack of actions and allow the user to rollback). 
 * This will require checking moves against the server without saving them. 
 * Each move you send the entire stack and the server tells you if it's still OK.
 * Alternative: Undo stack with DB backing. Every action should be reversable (delete it when reversed).

The hard stuff:
Todo: Vision / visibility - customise map w/ serverside imagemagick, only show some objects.
Todo: Height - allow multi-level maps.
