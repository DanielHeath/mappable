Rails mappable app

I want signup/auth that works.
/sessions/create (login)
/user (singular, current user)

I want have multiple maps
get /maps/#{name} (view specific map)

I want to make objects on the maps
post /maps/#{name}/objects

I want state to be preserved between maps
I want my app to return allow/deny info for a move, and update object info.
post /maps/#{name}/moves/ (ajax; send object-id, move info)

I want my app to track whose turn it is and how much movement/action everything has this turn.
I want to send my app actions other than movement (which should be customised when creating the object on the map).
I want objects that aren't selectable but interfere with movement.
I want a list of every move made in a given turn.


Schema:

users(acts_as_authenticated)
abilities( object_id:integer, name:string, action_type:string )

Controllers/Resources:
 * Signup
post /sessions/create (login)
resource /user (singular, current user or create user, profile page)
 * Maps
delete /maps/id (I'm done with this map.)
 * Moves
get /maps/id/turns/1/moves (list moves)

Order to create stuff in (most to least interesting)
Users / Logins
Users/Objects & Moves
Users/Maps

Set global 'animating' variable and ignore keystrokes while set || animate overlap transparency.

Delayed commit for actions (ie show a stack of actions and allow the user to rollback)

Squares with higher / lower movement costs.
Vision / visibility - customise map w/ serverside imagemagick, only show some objects.
Height - allow multi-level maps.

RSpec for controllers/models

Todo: Should be able to hook afterMove() (to do ajax-y stuff) and afterMoveSuccess() (which should only be called when all registered AJAX is finished.)
